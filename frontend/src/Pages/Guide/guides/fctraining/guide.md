# Tryouts

TDF is always looking for some new FC's!
Is fleet down during your prime time? Want to fix that? 

There is no pressure to accept a T badge straight away. You can ask to voice and/or tag a few fleets, see if it's for you. All thats required is an L badge! You can ask any full FC to do a tryout, you can do up to five tryouts.

If you have any doubts or questions, ask any FC, FC Trainer or council !

# Joining the training program

To officially join the training program you need an **L tag** and a fully skilled **primary booster** (no starter skills on waitlist) . the HQ mailing list has an EOS fit.

# Training program stages
## Trainee
In this first stage you will learn how to voice fleet, tag and doing waitlist invites/motd updates. You will be expected to learn and know every role and anchor position.

Progressing to the next stage requires passing **VAN FLEET** (yes seriously), It's a backseat with an FC Trainer, you will do invites trough channel waitlist so make sure you know all the fits ! 
## Advanced Trainee
In this stage efficiency, safety and in depth knowledge will be trained and expected. You will need to master contesting, knowing how the agro mechanics work. Knowing NPC's and why we tag them the way we do. Fleet control will also need to be mastered.

Progressing to the next stage requires passing **BUS FLEET** along with getting at least one other +1 from any FC Trainer or council.
## Probitionary FC
Fc's that just got tagged, they need 6 logi and cannot train nestors or new FC's. The Probitionary period can last up to 3 months.


# Tagging
You can have this open on your phone in your tryouts and/or first trainee fleets.
Make sure to set shortcuts for tagging, you need the sequencers 1 - 9 and A - I, A seperate shortcut for X tag and a shortcut for broadcast align.
