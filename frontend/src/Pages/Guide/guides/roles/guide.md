# Roles

Every fleet has specialty roles that need to be performed to allow our fleets to finish sites quickly and effectively, they range from managing your fleet members drones to acting as bait for an entire site. Irregardless of role, each is vital to our composition, and depending on your chosen ship you may be asked to fill the role so the fleet can continue to get paid. Remember when you join fleet you are automatically signing on to roles specific to your ship, if an FC asks for a role to be filled you should x-up for it immediately by typing xDDD etc for respective roles. Its much appreciated!

## Role types

Below you can see all the available roles with a brief description, more concise explanation of each role will be detailed as you continue down the page.

| Role          | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DDD**       | The light drone bunny, shoots frigates in all sites. Fulfilled by a single Vindicator                                                 |
| **HHH**       | The heavy drone bunny, shoots untagged cruisers and numbers backwards. Fulfilled by up to three Vindicators.                          |

# Role Specifics

## DDD

As DDD you will be responsible for killing frigates in all sites every wave, while challenging, DDD can be by far the most rewarding role, we recommend a high level of minmatar battleship, and to be fitted with 3 webifiers. While in this role you should recieve tracking links from (at minimum) your onieros logi, this will help to improve your tracking speed and optimal range for your guns, if you are not recieving links, speak up!

### General tips for DDD

Try to sit still as much as possible, hitting frigates with large guns is not easy and requires you to be webbing targets and keeping your transversal velocity as low as possible (you can add transversal to your overview in the columns section). Burning around with your MWD on will result in continually missed hits and no dead frigates. Ship placement during waves will help you significantly, so be in position before wave spawns, if aggro switches move to a place where you can be effective!

There is a priority order to frigates, but remember to always shoot the frigates closest to optimal, and with the lowest transversal, you will kill them much faster this way so keep checking your overview, and memorise your optimal ranges with each ammo type.

You will have light drones as support but they are NOT your main source of damage, so make sure to keep shooting. Splitting your gun groupings can be beneficial to kill multiple frigates at once and helps to keep drones shooting. If you are struggling for damage however keep your guns grouped together.

If a wave spawn is pulled away from you switch to Null! Do not be idle, you can still kill off frigates with Null. If frigates are out of web range, overheat your webs, it costs very little in paste to repair webs so make good use of it. Use both groups of guns to kill single targets if needed.

The meatshield or MS is usually tagged with the letter Z, use this to aid you in finding where to anchor during waves as the meatshield often acts as aggro for most sites.

### TPPH

- 1st room burn forward one or two propmod cycles or keep aggro target at range 5km, prioritise Schmaeels, then Tama. At the beginning of the room have Null loaded to try to kill one or two as they burn in close, switch to either Void or Antimatter and work through remaining frigates.
- 2nd room burn forward or set aggro target to keep at range 5km. Kill the four frigates as fast as you can so you can carry on with your burn.
- 3rd room burn directly to your anchor, you want to be between the 2nd wave spawn and the MS but on the closer side to the MS. When the 2nd wave spawns and the MS pulls aggro towards itself you should be well within web range of the frigates. Start with Schmaeels first then on to Tamas. The 2nd wave of frigates is the hardest to kill due to their large number compared to the rest of the wave, you are racing to kill the frigates before the last Ostingele is killed.

### NRF

- 1st wave you want to burn towards the aggro target and keep at range 5km, depending on the size of the spawn you may need to start anchoring before the wave dies. Be in position for next wave! Use all the tricks you have learned, there will be a switch so prepare for that and spread your webs accordingly.
- 2nd, 3rd & 4th wave your anchor will be above the MS and between them and the wave spawns, this way the frigates should come to you. Start with Schmaeels, then onto Tamas. Remember to burn in to the 4th wave to help shoot everything else once frigates are dead.

### TCRC

- Niarjas are your **TOP** priority in this site, this is because they Jam & Neut, they also respawn. When you land on the beacon sit still, and using null, quickly kill the closest Niarja. Next spread your webs for nearby Schmaeels but dont bother with the tag X's. Switch to Void or Antimatter (if you have the range) and try to kill off as many Schmaeels as you can before the aggro switchs. When aggro switches the remaining Schmaeels will burn toward the tower so align and MJD to the left of it. When you land kill the remaining Niarja & between Niarja respawns kill off untagged Schmaeels.
  **Remember the Niarja is priority number one so kill it the moment it respawns**. When there are no untagged Schmaeels left web the x's and help shoot the tower.

## HHH

Your role as HHH is to keep the entire fleets Heavy drones as active as possible, the more time they are shooting, the higher our DPS is, the faster we run sites, so as a HHH target selection is very important.

As a general rule the HHH shoots untagged cruisers, then number tags backwards (nine to one). But within this rule you can use your judgement to try to keep the drones assigned to you applying as much as possible, for example; if an untagged Vylade has no shield left and is still being shot then the full health Ostingele would be the better option to shoot. This kind of thinking generally only comes in to play mid to latter end of waves however. At the start of the wave the general rule applies or FC commands.

### General tips for HHH

The drones assigned to you can travel to and still hit targets far outside your max range, so if the last few targets in a wave are outside of your range shooting them just once is enough to send the drones over to aid in its destruction.

Keep reactivating or "cycling" your guns, when you enter a site, pilots will gradually add more and more drones to your pool, some pilots are slower than others. So check back on occasion to see if you have any idle drones orbiting you, and if so turn your guns/web off and re-apply them to get those drones shooting.

The drones under your care react to the last activated aggressive module, so in other words, your guns, or webifiers. For example; if you wished to shoot a Romi, but have the drones attack the Vylade, you would shoot and web the Romi first, then apply the remaining webifier to the Vylade, this will send the drones to attack the Vylade while you are free to apply gun damage to the Romi. You do not need to keep the module active, however remember that the moment you re-apply it somewhere else the drones will adjust their target.

Try to take into account the distance to a target, and whether the time taken for drones to travel a long distance would be worthwhile. The last ship in a wave 60km away would not really benefit from the drones as it would most likely be killed before they arrive. This leaves the drones having to travel back to you as the next wave spawns & their overall application time is reduced even further than if you had simply let them sit idle next to you.

## MTAC/CIVI

Your role as MTAC is to stop the tower from repairing during the TCRC site, to do this it requires the pilot to transfer an item called the "MTAC" from its factory to the Shield Array Container. This process must be repeated until the tower is destroyed.

Your role as CIVI is to retrieve the civilians from the cargo containers dropped by the NPC's and place them into the "obelisk" allowing for completion of the site, payout will not happen until this objective is completed.

### General tips for MTAC

You will need to have your Tractor Beam equipped. You want to be one of the first people on grid when the FC calls the gate green. Align and MJD to the MTAC factory as soon as you land. With the Bastion changes its alot more important to get the first drop done as soon as possible as pilots will be jumping from the beacon once the Deltoles are dead (if not sooner).

Check for ships/pilots around you, if you see that they might potentially bump you, call it out. Ultimately it will be down to you to ensure you can jump to the correct spot. Should you get bumped let the FC know that the drop will be delayed.

When you land at the MTAC factory jettison an item from your cargo, lock, open and tractor your can. Put the can in the second row of your locks so you dont accidentally shoot it yourself. Open the MTAC factory and drop the MTAC into your can, then burn over to the Shield Array Tower, once within 2500m drop the MTAC into the Shield Array Tower (be carefull not to bounce too far away from the Tower on approach). You can call out "dropped" in coms to let the fleet/FC know. At this point lock the tower and shoot it to secure your payout. Finally, burn back to the MTAC factory and repeat the process until the tower is destroyed. **Never stop dropping**.

As MTAC due to your close proximity to structures you are allowed to warp to the next broadcast as soon as the tower dies (instead of waiting for scrams to be killed). This is to try to prevent MTACs being caught on structure hitboxes and being left behind during exits.

During contests its important MTACs jump to the MTAC factory and try to secure the MTAC before the opposing fleet, generally if you have managed to obtain it the FC will want you to drop straight away, but always check with them first.

As a Paladin you can learn to bastion cycle between drops, make sure you are comfortable with the role before attempting this however. Do not bastion after the last drop as you will need to exit the site quickly. When you become proficient with the role try to add in steps to further your speed, lock the tower earlier to shoot it sooner **(do not be the first person to shoot the tower at any point)** etc.

### General tips for CIVI

To effectively do this role we ask for Paladins with T2 tractor beams due to their extended range, upon entering an OCF in assaults the CIVI should head toward the "obelisk". When cans spawn as NPCs are destroyed tractor them to you. Once you have a total of 40 civilains drop them into the freighter. You will have leftovers so you can save them for the next site if you wish or discard them. Once 40 civilians are in the freighter it will warp off and the site will be complete and your payout will appear.

## MS

Your role as MS is to provide safer entrances to TCRC sites by consolidating aggro on one target (yourself). Having previous scouting knowledge here helps but isnt a requirement. We usually ask pilots to MS in our doctrine fit Damnation which can be found on the in game mailing list. However should a damnation not be available any bastion ship with full amulet implants (1-6) can be given the role, failing this as a last resort a bastion ship fitted with an additional extra plate can also safely do the role.

As MS it is important the FC can hear you clearly and that you respond in a timely manner, during a site entrance the comms should be clear to allow this. After confirming you have recieved armor boosts and been given the call for "meatshield and meatshield only" you should broadcast for armor & capacitor then take the acceleration gate. Avoid using any trigger words when doing this so that pilots do not accidentally follow you in.

As you are warping in to the site there are four stages the site can be called, this is to let the FC know how long they need to wait before sending the fleet in. As each new wave spawns you should call what you see as per below:

- If there are no Deltoles the site is called "Normal"
- If there are only Deltole NPCs within 40km the site is "Deltoles"
- If there are Deltoles and Frigates within 40km the site is "Frigates"
- If there are Outunis the site is "Full"
