# Upgrading

If you're low on ISK, you can start by getting the **Megathron**. If you do, it's important that you focus on upgrading to another ship as soon as possible. TDF works with a tier system. Pilots can be categorized as starter, basic, elite and elite gold.

## Starter

1. **Get a starter fit**, you will need level 2 armor compensation skills to be able to x-up, and you need to be able to online all the modules from the fit. (If you are Alpha status and cannot use the MJD in cargo this is fine, we understand pilots will need time to Omega their accounts)
2. Get a Nightmare or Vindicator then Omega your account ASAP.

## Basic
**Upgrade to basic fits** as soon as you can.

1. Train/inject armor compensation skills to level 4.
2. **Tank and rig change to basic fit or better** (do this upgrade all at once!) All rigs and tank modules must be changed to match the basic fit or you will not be allowed to join fleet. These modules include:
- Damage Control Units
- Multispectrum Coatings
- Burst Aerator Rigs
- Resistance Rigs (Thermal, EM, Kinetic, Explosive)

3. Train Starter coloured skills starting with warp drive operation, gunnery skills, MJD etc, leaving drones until last.
4. Train and get T2 guns and the remainder of the basic fit modules starting with the Core X-Type MWD (this will help greatly with your cap stability) then Magnetic Field Stabilizers & Heat Sinks etc.

Once you have the basic fit ready to go, continue **training and injecting basic skills** which will help your capacitor stability and the ability to keep up with the fleet. At this point you are no longer starter and will be placed in a normal squad, congratulations!

## Advanced

1. **Upgrade to the advanced fit.** Your skills will already be sufficient, so buy those new modules!

2. **Get your Hybrid set implants**. You will need cybernetics 5 trained for the hard wires. The recommended purchase order for the set is:
- Slot 10 (6% damage Alpha) make sure you get the implant that corresponds to your gun type!
- Slot 9 (6% damage ROF)
- Slot 8 (6% capacitor capacity)
- Slot 7 (6% tracking) Remember to buy the Ogdin's Eye as its usually cheaper on market than the MR-706 from concord LP store.
- Slot 6 (6% warpspeed)
- Slots 1-5 (Amulets increase your overall Armor HP and also have stat bonus)

Once your set is complete you can upgrade to the _HYBRID fits on the mailing list, which adds a lot of damage!

3. **Train bastion requirements** if you are going for bastion fits.
- Choose between Kronos/Paladin.
- Train Weapon Upgrades 5, Adv Weapon Upgrades 5 & Energy Grid Upgrades 5.
- All tank skills must be at basic level or higher (see skills page)
- You must be able to online and use all modules/drones in the bastion fits so train/inject as appropriate.

## Elite

Now it's time to get the **elite fit**. You do not need to have every skill at elite level to fly the fit! Go buy those upgrades while still training/injecting the skills. 

- This is a good time to get **abyssal modules**. [mutaplasmid.space](https://mutaplasmid.space/) is a good website for finding contracts, but remember abyssals must be "better than faction". See the badges section for Bastion badge requirements for abyssals should you wish to obtain it.

 - Finish by getting all the **elite skills**. The order is up to you, but we recommend getting the skills that give the biggest damage increase first, and of course maximize your survivability by upgrading the tank skills.

At this point we would like to **thank you** for upgrading, you can spend your isk as you see fit from this point on.

## Elite gold

Finally, once you have all skills to elite gold for your ship get your **elite gold** badge to show off your awesomeness. Just ask any FC who is not running the current fleet to check you meet the requirements.

## Branch out

Once you're done upgrading, consider branching out to another ship. Maybe try logistics? If you are in a timezone with low pilot numbers consider training up another DPS alt and earn twice the payouts!
