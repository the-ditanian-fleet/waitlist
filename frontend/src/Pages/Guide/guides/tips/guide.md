# General Tips

## Item Variants

There are many items in eve that have variants with identical stats but different names. Saved fittings will just save what has been fitted. When looking at saved fittings be sure to check the market for module variants. The module stats are what matters not that the exact same module is used. Very often you can get the same fitting for less money.

This saved Nightmare fitting could be bought for less if I buy the True Sansha Heat Sinks and the Corpum A-Type MEMs. Drag and drop items into the Compare Tool or go to item variations and click compare.

Commonly used items are:

- Damage Control Unit
- Magnetic Field Stabilizer
- Heat Sink
- Multispectrum Energized Membrane
- Tracking Computer
- Sensor Booster
- Stasis Webifier
- Antimatter Ammunition

There is also the case of the Ogdin's Eye Coordination Enhancer which has the same tracking bonus as the MR-706 but the Ogdin is much cheaper.

## How to Recover from a Leeroy

Let's say you leeroyed the wrong gate (went into the wrong site), or got left behind. Don't worry, you can get out!

#### First of all, don't panic.

Panicking is just going to get you killed. What you want to do is switch to your "All," "Warpout," "Podsaver," or similar overview that contains celestials (planets and moons). Make sure you have your MJD equipped; if you don't have it, try to warp. If you get pointed by the rats and don't have an MJD... well, RIP.

Next, align towards a random celestial that isn't in line with the rats. (Also, don't warp to belts.) You're going to have to warp out to this celestial, so make sure you're not aligning towards the rats. If the rats are far away and you can warp out, do so! If the rats are dangerously close, hit your MJD, and once you get jumped you should be well out of range of the rats and able to warp.

Now you know how to get out if everything goes wrong and you leeroy a gate (which hopefully never happens).

## Piloting Tricks

### Q-Align

"Q-aligning" is a trick to move your ship to any position on grid. First, you will need the tactical overlay on, as shown in the image:

Next, hold the q key and move your mouse anywhere on grid: a blue number will appear, denoting the number of kilometers you will move.

Then, click once, and you have set your horizontal angle and distance. Drag your mouse up or down to set your vertical angle, or just click again to move horizontal.

Now, you have started moving your ship to the specified location on grid.

### Gate sliding

When coming out of warp on a gate, specifically in TPPH rooms 2 and 3 and entry into an NRF, you can use a little of the speed from the warp to start moving instantly. You can keep at range/approach an object or q-align somewhere, but my personally recommended approach is to use the + button on your throttle, as shown below, to start accelerating to full speed in the direction you're facing.

### Getting out of a site fast

Late exits can kill people. Not only should you always be listening to the FC, and watching for new align to/warp to broadcasts, you can get ready for an exit in 2 seconds: hold A and click on the Align To broadcast to align there, and hit Shift+R to recall your drones. Then, you will be ready to warp out when the FC calls for it.

### Stopping your ship quickly

To stop your burn quickly, you can Q-Align or double click directly backwards in space, which will slow you down faster than just Ctrl+Spacing to stop your ship.

### Bastion + MWD Trick

This only applies to marauders, but it can be useful if FC calls for one more bastion cycle than usual to get to a contest on time. You can give yourself an accelerated warp out using your MWD when nearing the end of bastion cycles, once your bastion cycle is at 10 seconds or less cycle your MWD once (make sure to red cycle it!). When your bastion cycle ends initiate warp to next destination and when your MWD cycle ends you will in effect insta warp out, similarly to the MWD + Cloak trick.

## Storing your pods

NGA (another community) and IOMEG (a corp) commonly have citadels with clone bays in each focus, but these are not always safe and do not come up until around a day after the focus comes up. Until then, you can store your clone(s) in NPC stations or anonymous player-owned citadels, but that carries a risk. After the focus goes down, make sure you get all your assets and clones out of player-owned citadels - NGA is infamous for taking down their clone bays remarkably fast, so your clone _will_ be destroyed if you leave it in there. IOMEG will usually leave their citadels up longer, but you still run a risk, and any third-party citadels are use at your own risk.

## Hotkeys

Know your hotkeys, as they're very useful. You will also want to set new hotkeys for certain things. A list of the most important hotkeys is below:

- Align to: A
- Launch drones: Shift+F
- Recall drones: Shift+R
- Lock target: Ctrl
- Stop ship: Ctrl+Space
- Modules: F1-12 for highs, Alt+F1-12 for mids
- Approach: Q
- D-Scan: V
- Orbit: W
- Activate gate: D
- Warp to: S
  Broadcast buttons can also be hotkeyed, but please do this with caution as the broadcasts sometimes don't go through. If in doubt, just use the buttons in the Fleet window. Tagging hotkeys are also invaluable for FCs and training FCs, and these will differ by the individual.

## Travel Tips

Travelling between focuses can get you killed if you're not careful. Take the proper precautions and you're unlikely to lose your ship.

### **DO NOT GO THROUGH LOWSEC.**

First rule of moving. You _WILL_ get ganked.

### Scout ahead.

Make sure to scout ahead and check eve-gatecheck.space and UedamaScout, linked below, before moving, especially through known gank pipes. Gank pipes include the 0.6 chain in Devoid around Odin, Uedama (0.5) and Sivala (0.6), Deltole and its 0.5 pipe, and Bagodan (0.7).

### Travel fit.

Make sure to travel fit your incursion ship, we have travel fits in our TDF-ANTIGANK mailing list. Also make sure to move your blingy modules in a taxi, preferably sub2 align and/or cloaky, such as a Sunesis, Hecate, Jackdaw, Astero, or other. Do note that cloakies can be decloaked, and sub2 align is technically catchable, so a sub1 ship like the Hecate or Jackdaw is theoretically best.

### OPSEC.

Don't give out intel for free ("I'm approaching Odin" or something), TDF-Official is a public channel.

### Use the MWD+Cloak Trick.

Most people know this already, but it will be put here for those who don't. With an Improved Cloaking Device II and 500MN Microwarpdrive fit to your battleship, you can be almost uncatchable on most gates. Here's how:

After jumping into a new system, align to the next gate, redcycle (run for one cycle only) your MWD, and hit your cloak. Wait until the MWD has about 1-2 seconds left on its cycle, then turn off your cloak and spam warp to your next location; you should effectively instawarp after your cloak turns off.

We don't want you to lose your ship, so make sure to keep it safe!
