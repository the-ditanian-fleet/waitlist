# Badges

## What are badges for?

Badges are a tool mostly for FCs to quickly see what the fleet composition looks like and to check a pilots fitting meets requirements. Used to quickly verify information about a pilot without the need for every FC to know exactly what every pilot has. Plus some people like them. To obtain a badge, ask an FC and they will start the process.
