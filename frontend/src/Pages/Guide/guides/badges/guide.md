# Badges

## Uses

Badges are a tool mostly for FCs to quickly see what the fleet composition looks like and to check a pilots fitting meets requirements. Used to quickly verify information about a pilot without the need for every FC to know exactly what every pilot has on every toon they have in the whole game.

And some people like them.

To attain an implant badge, mail any FC with a screenshot of the set. For others, mail an FC and they will start the process of you getting it.
