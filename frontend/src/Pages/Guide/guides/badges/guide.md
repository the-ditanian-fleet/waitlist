# Badges

## Uses

Badges are a tool mostly for FCs to quickly see what the fleet composition looks like and to check a pilots fitting meets requirements. Used to quickly verify information about a pilot without the need for every FC to know exactly what every pilot has on every toon they have in the whole game.

And some people like them.

To attain a badge, ask an FC and they will start the process of you getting it.
