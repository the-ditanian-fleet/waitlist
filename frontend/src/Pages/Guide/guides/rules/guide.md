# TDF rules

## General Rules

## Invite policy

1. Any pilot who is able to meet basic tank requirements _and_ is able to fly a doctrine fit from one of the TDF FIT mailing lists should always be able to get into the fleet.
1. Any pilot below the "basic skills" counts as starter. If pilots are running more than 4 weeks without basic skills they get a 1 month ban to train all missing skills.
1. FCs should run fleets with no more than 4 starter pilots on grid, to ensure the fleet is ISK-effective.

1. Pilots who repeatedly sandbag, or who are continually distracted in fleets, should be removed from the fleet for their own safety after fair warning.
1. Any kind of strong harassment in TS / discord or ingame (e.g. homophobic, racicist)
1. Refusal to take gates during a contest will result in a 24hr ban for first offence and may be escalated to council issuing a permaban for further offenses.
1. Partaking in HS ganking of known incursion players will result in a ban
1. STEALING IS A BANNABLE OFFENSE!
