# Bastion guide

With the Bastions of War changes, marauders now do double damage while in Bastion. This is obviously huge but comes at the downside of being unable to receive reps from logi. This guide should cover most things you need to know to run Bastion whilst receiving SRP. The bastion badge, which requires full elite + abyssal damage mods is not required to use bastion, but it is encouraged to obtain it.

Pilot error is NOT COVERED under SRP. If you Bastion by mistake at the wrong time, no SRP. If you jump out of rep range, no SRP.

Bastion is for experienced incursion runners only. This means to use it you MUST:

1.  Know how aggro works in incursions.
2.  Know all the incursion sites
3.  Know how logistics work (especially armor reps).
4.  Know the different Sansha rats.
5.  Be able to communicate with the FC.

## General rules/requirements if you want SRP

1.  **Auto repeat is off at all times.**
2.  **Bastion in lowest module row, NO SHORTCUT!**
3.  You do not Bastion until aggro is established on one target at the start of a wave/site.
4.  If someone dies on-grid you are to turn Bastion off for the rest of the site.
5.  Amulets in slots 1 - 5 is required for SRP.
6.  All tank skills must be at basic level for your chosen ship or higher (check skills page)
7.  Be aware when using the micro jump drive of your direction, and of bumps. If you jump poorly and die due to being out of logi range, this is pilot error and WILL NOT be covered under SRP. (Being bumped by another fleet member is also not covered under SRP). If you're not confident, DO NOT USE IT.

## Site guidance

### TPPH

First two rooms: burn with microwarpdrive towards the out gate, once you reach max speed turn off MWD and bastion for 1 cycle to slide, use high DPS ammo where possible. Once bastion cycle finishes continue to burn to out gate.

Third room: Bastion 1 cycle on beacon, then align and jump towards the left-upper side of the tower. Burn 1 microwarpdrive cycle back towards spawn. Paladins want to end up ABOVE the 2nd/3rd wave spawns.

### NRF

Paladin: Bastion 1 cycle on the beacon, then angle up about 20 degrees and jump. (You want to try and put yourself between the sniper spawns for 2nd and 3rd wave). Stay here until 4th wave and bastion when safe during 2nd and 3rd waves, on 4th wave jump towards sniper targets as per FC commands.

Kronos: Microwarpdrive towards 2nd and 3rd wave (the furthest small tower) and if there is time bastion cycle/slide 1 time. Once at the anchor Bastion when safe until the middle of 3rd wave (or sooner) to allow for your final burn to 4th wave CQC anchor spot (Do not over bastion in Mara wave as your DPS is more important during 4th wave)

### TCRC

TCRCs are special, and you are mostly likely to grab aggro due to your high dps. If you get aggro while in Bastion do not panic, broadcast for shield so logi can lock you, and provide a countdown in fleet chat or voice comms. A second before coming out you will re-broadcast for armor, so logi can spam reps. If you fail to do this, you will not get SRP.

1. After aggro is on the meat shield and the meat shield is stable you can do one cycle on the beacon. (We recommend putting the meat shield on your watch list because if you need to battle-rep him, do it! If he dies and you are in Bastion, you are most likely the next target and we cannot rep you.)
2. During the one cycle kill tagged Deltoles/Outunis in order. After the cycle is done jump to the left of the tower.
3. Keep shooting but wait for the aggro swap from the meat shield to whomever, WAIT for the full switch!!! Once this happens you should have enough time for 1 cycle of bastion. If you are quick, you CAN get 2 cycles but please get used to 1 cycle before trying 2.
4. After each FULL switch you can Bastion 1 cycle. DO NOT Bastion when the tower is in hull unless otherwise instructed by FC.

Be very mindful of your fellow bastion pilots when jumping from the beacon, be aligned correctly right between the tower and the Sansha Starbase Shield Transfer Array (balls) or there will be bumps! Patience is key and if waiting a moment longer prevents a bump then do so.

## Additional tips

- **Late Entry**. If you enter a TCRC late and the aggro switches to you on the beacon you must check to see if your logi are in rep range, if they are not because they already burned to the tower, or they are quickly approaching it then you must jump immediately and make them aware of the situation.
- **Split Aggro Entrance**. If on a normal TCRC entrance you accidentally get aggro instead of the meat shield make sure to check if you have enough capacitor to jump, and if not ask for battle cap. If you have the Outuni aggro you should have already broadcasted for capacitor. Nestors will be burning towards the tower the moment they enter site so do not get left behind.
- **MJD Cancel**. If you MJD and get bumped you can cycle your bastion module on to prevent the jump from happening, but be aware this will leave you in your current spot and in bastion, so stop shooting and do not pull aggro, you will have the full MJD cooldown timer and your bastion cycle time, our recomendation at this point is to burn with microwarpdrive as normal to anchor once your bastion cycle ends.
- **MWD Trick**. You can give yourself an accelerated warp out using your MWD when nearing the end of bastion cycles, once your bastion cycle is at 10 seconds or less cycle your MWD once (make sure to red cycle it!), when your bastion cycle ends initiate warp to next destination and when your MWD cycle ends you will in effect insta warp out.
- **Stuck Bastion**. If your Bastion module gets stuck on, a workaround that has worked (but not in all cases) has been to move the module to a different row on your module interface.
