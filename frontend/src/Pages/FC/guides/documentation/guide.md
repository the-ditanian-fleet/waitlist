## Rules

Full rules document can be found in the in game FC channel & pinned on FC discord. Most important FC specific rules listed below.

### Inviting

Upgrade numbers (check their history to judge!)

- 20 hour limit for megathron
- 60 hours to get out of starter
- 100 hours to get to advanced fit (DPS & Logi)
- 150 hours for elite logi cruisers
- 225 hours for elite Vindicator + Nestor
- 250 hours for elite bastion

1. Any pilot who is able to meet basic tank requirements and is able to fly a doctrine fit from one of the TDF FITS mailing lists should always be able to get into the fleet.
2. 3x times disconnect from game & TeamSpeak -> no re-invite

### Multiboxing

1. Alts should be dropped in favor of a real players, even starter.

_FC's are allowed to invite Elite pilot Bastion alts when starter squad is full to stay competitive VS other communities, dont abuse it though._

2. The active FC is permitted to take two payouts as a reward

### Logi requirements

1. **Full FC**: TCRC &amp; NRF **3:1**, TPPH **2:2**
2. **PHQ/Trainee FC**: TCRC &amp; NRF **3:3**, TPPH **2:2**
    - Nestors can replace cruisers, but not the other way around, you should have cruisers where possible due to their utility and you must still run the correct number of logi. 
    - FC Trainers and Council can override these requirements while in fleet.
3. Basic skills are all **required** except on the Basic fit oneiros which can be run with Logistics cruisers at level 4.

### Misc

1. Every member above the hierarchy of the active FC may cancel an active FC decision. This must be limited to a minimum and for good reasons (e.g. safety or active FC breaking rules).
2. Any FC should announce a TDF fleet in discord while (re)forming or after taking over the fleet. Limit your pings 1 per hour in discord.
3. FCs should run fleets with no more than 4 starter pilots on grid, to ensure the fleet is ISK-effective.
4. Mom is done on a community rotation, ask in discord #TDF-FC for more information.
5. Only full FC's may backseat Nestors or Trainee's

## Loss mail
