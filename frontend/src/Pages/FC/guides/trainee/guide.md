## Fleet Start Safety Speech

LOGIs build your watch lists, FC, boosters, other logis, ect.

Please make sure safety is set to **GREEN**
No **WAR DECS**
No **KILL RIGHTS**
No **Faction Warfare**
(This is an EDENCOM system, if you are red with EDENCOM, please do not fly here, as there can be roaming fleets that will kill you)

Make sure arrows at the bottom of the fleet window are pointing in all four directions.
During fleet. When you become yellow boxed by NPCs, Broadcast for armor.

All Drones must be set to passive and focus fire and assigned to appropriate drone bunnies unless specified otherwise.
Your duels should be set to auto-reject, and your auto-lockback set to zero.
Emergency warp should be left unchecked, please confirm yours is set correctly.
X-tag is a fleet safety tag, please never shoot X tags.
However FC voice has higher priority than tags, you must listen to and follow FC commands at all times.

To join fleet, Warp to FC twice, if you get the error message natural phenomena, ask for gate status.

Last but not least, we strongly recommend that you pay 15 mil to the ship replacement program AKA SRP (details in fleet MOTD). It covers your ship up to 7 bil value from pay in until DT for FC and LOGI errors only.
