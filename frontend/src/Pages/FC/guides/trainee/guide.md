## Fleet Start Safety Speech

LOGIs build your watch lists, FC, boosters, other logis, ect.

Please make sure safety is set to **GREEN**
No **WAR DECS**
No **KILL RIGHTS**
No **Faction Warfares**
(This is an EDENCOM system, if you are red with EDENCOM, please do not fly here, as there can be roaming fleets that will kill you)

Make sure Arrows at the bottom of fleet window are pointing all 4 directions
During fleet. When you become yellow boxed by NPCs, Broadcast for armor

All Drones must be set to passive and focus fire and assigned to appropriate drone bunnies unless specified otherwise
X-tag is a fleet safety tag, please never shoot X tags.
However FC voice has higher priority than tags, you must listen to and follow FC commands at all times.

To join fleet, Warp to FC twice, if you get error message natural phenomena, ask for gate status

Last but not least, we strongly recommend that you pay 15 mil to the ship replacement program AKA SRP (details in fleet MOTD), covers your ship up to 7 bil value from DT to DT for FC and LOGI errors only.

Any questions?
